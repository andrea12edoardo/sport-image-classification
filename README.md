# ðŸ“– About

This project investigates the performance of image classification neural networks leveraging pre-trained models. The main objective is to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of various architectures in recognizing and categorizing sports images. The analysis compares a neural network developed from scratch to various pre-trained models under diverse training configurations, assessing key metrics such as accuracy and computational complexity.

# Dataset

The [100 Sports Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification) (available on Kaggle) contains more than 100,000 color images (224Ã—224 pixels) representing 100 different sports categories. For this project, 10 categories were selected, each with 15 to 20 images. 
The dataset is then organized into balanced training, validation, and test sets.
